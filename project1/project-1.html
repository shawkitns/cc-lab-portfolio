        <h2>Our first project was a two-person assignment where each person had to describe in words a sentimental item that they had lost, and their partner had to draw it.
            Kind of like pictionary, but with p5js.</h2>

        <div class="project-info">
        <h3>Reflection: If Kristy had lost a wallet from H&M or Target or Walmart or anything else that would've cost less than 20$, then I wouldn't need any details. But it was a Balenciaga wallet, which I had never seen before. However,Kristy's ellaborate description helped paint a vivid picture that was easy to translate from text to code. Additionally, she also gave more context by providing a breakdown of the shapes which further simplified the process.</h3>
<h3>The shapes along with their respective colors in the description gave me a good blueprint to visualize my design. I envisioned a black wallet with grey/silver highlights at the top. I didn't think it would be bulky like the normal wallets and would be more compact and minimalistic, as most luuxry brands are. 
</h3>
<h3>An area that I did struggle with was the number of pockets to include. I used one large flap fold pocket and wasn't sure if Kristy wanted me to show the front and back. Another area was the graffitis. I emulated the concept of graffitis by using triangles without any fill.</h3>
<h3>In conlclusion, I had fun designing a Kristy's lost and found item, and this assignment helped me hone the fundamentals of p5js.</h3>
