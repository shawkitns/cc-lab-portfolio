    <h3>Hi, I’m Shawki—Engineer, Designer, Performer. Currently in grad school at Parsons School of Design. Born in India, raised in Saudi Arabia, and educated in the UAE, I’m now in New York, trying to mix all those experiences into something creative. When I’m not waiting for the elevators at the D12 building, you’ll find me building, designing, or performing. Always looking for the next project that'll make me lose sleep and add a few more gray hairs.</h3>
